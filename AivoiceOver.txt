Welcome to ChronoWell! I’m thrilled to guide you through your personalized cognitive wellness journey. Together, we’ll explore the key features designed to help you maintain and enhance your cognitive health.

When you first open ChronoWell, you’ll land on the Onboarding screen — the starting point of your wellness adventure. After logging in, you’ll be asked if youve taken chronowell today and shown you current streak of active days.Dont forget that chronowell needs to be taken daily to show full effects. Now lets introduce your Home screen, your daily command center.

At the bottom of the Home screen, you’ll find five navigation icons: Home, My Hub, AI Coach, Activities, and Medical Portal. These icons serve as your gateways to different aspects of your cognitive wellness. You can also use the Home screen to quickly access app features or check the daily challenges curated by your AI Coach.

Speaking of the coach, lets introduce it to you. Just Tap the brain icon to acess your AI personal cognitive coach. You can choose how you want to interact with it: speak naturally using the microphone icon or type using the text input. Daily check-ins are key — share how you’re feeling, your energy levels, or any cognitive challenges. Your AI Coach will analyze this information and recommend personalized activities, whether it’s a meditation session, a cognitive exercise, or an educational resource. You can even start your check-in directly from the Home screen for added convenience.

Next, explore the Activities section, where you’ll find three key areas for cognitive enhancement. The Cognitive Assessment area offers engaging exercises that challenge your mind while tracking your progress. The Meditation space provides guided sessions for relaxation and mental clarity. And the Learning Resources section delivers curated educational content to deepen your understanding of cognitive health and wellness practices.

Now, let’s take a look at My Hub — your personal cognitive dashboard. Here, you’ll see your Overall Score, with a breakdown of your performance across Memory, Focus, and Problem-Solving abilities. Watch your progress come to life through beautiful, interactive charts. You can also view your personal goals, complete with progress bars and target scores. Need to adjust your goals? Simply tap 'Edit Goals' to set new targets. Your Ai Coach will take these into account when evaluating your daily check-in and proposing your challenges. Also don’t forget to visit the Community Hub to connect with others on their wellness journey. Or access your Profile Settings to personalize your experience.

Finally, the Medical Portal is your healthcare hub, designed to keep your wellness journey professionally supported. Here, you can view and download your latest medical reports, connect with healthcare providers through the Caregiver Portal, manage upcoming virtual consultations, and access or update your family medical history.

Every feature within ChronoWell is thoughtfully designed to support and guide you on your path to cognitive wellness. Let’s get started and make every day a step toward a healthier, more vibrant mind!
